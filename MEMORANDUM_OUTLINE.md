## II. COMPANY MARKETING PROFILE

**Heritage and Market Position:**
Ford Motor Company, with 122 years of automotive leadership, underwent a pivotal transformation in 2018 that redefined its marketing approach. The strategic reorganization into three distinct business units—Ford Blue (traditional ICE vehicles), Ford Model e (electric vehicles), and Ford Pro (commercial solutions)—enabled precise market segmentation and targeted positioning strategies aligned with the STP (Segmentation, Targeting, Positioning) framework from our marketing intelligence coursework (DSCI-5330, Session 6).

**Marketing Evolution Context:**
The company's journey from a monolithic brand structure to a segmented approach demonstrates sophisticated application of perceptual mapping and brand positioning concepts. Revenue growth from $127.1B (2020) to $185.0B (2024) occurred alongside marketing efficiency improvements, validating the strategic restructuring (Ford 10-K, 2024).

**Current Brand Architecture:**
- **Ford Blue**: Leverages heritage and trust (4 brand attributes: Capability, Passion, Community, Trust)
- **Ford Model e**: Targets innovation-focused consumers through cognitive decision-making appeals
- **Ford Pro**: Emphasizes B2B relationship marketing and customer lifetime value optimization

## III. MARKETING APPROACH ANALYSIS

### A. Historical Marketing Evolution (2015-2024)

**Phase 1: Traditional Product-First Marketing (2015-2018)**

*Marketing Intelligence Application:*
During this period, Ford employed traditional marketing mix (4Ps) focusing heavily on Product features and Price promotions. Marketing spend averaged 1.58% of revenue with limited customer intelligence integration (Ford Annual Reports, 2015-2018).

**Table 1: Marketing Investment & Returns (2015-2018)**
| Year | Marketing Spend ($B) | Revenue ($B) | Marketing % | ROI Ratio |
|------|---------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| 2015 | 2.3 | 149.6 | 1.54% | 3.22 |
| 2016 | 2.4 | 151.8 | 1.58% | 1.92 |
| 2017 | 2.5 | 156.8 | 1.59% | 3.04 |
| 2018 | 2.6 | 160.3 | 1.62% | 1.42 |
*(Source: Ford 10-K Reports, 2015-2018)*

*Consumer Behavior Analysis:*
Limited application of consumer decision-making process understanding resulted in declining ROI from 3.22 to 1.42, indicating misalignment with evolving customer preferences (Statista, 2024).

**Phase 2: Strategic Transformation (2019-2021)**

*Market Intelligence Systems Implementation:*
Ford initiated comprehensive market research and consumer analysis, applying conjoint analysis techniques to understand feature-value trade-offs. The pandemic year (2020) saw marketing maintained at 1.65% despite revenue decline to $127.1B, demonstrating commitment to brand investment during crisis (Ford 10-K, 2020).

**Phase 3: Data-Driven Marketing (2022-2024)**

*Business Intelligence Integration:*
Deployment of customer data platforms (CDP) in 2023 enabled 360° customer view, resulting in 22% improvement in lead conversion. Marketing efficiency improved to 1.39% of revenue while maintaining effectiveness (Ford Annual Report, 2023).

### B. Current "Ready, Set, Ford" Strategy (2025)

**Campaign Framework Analysis:**

*Strategic Positioning Shift:*
The campaign applies sophisticated consumer psychology principles, moving from cognitive decision-making appeals to emotional engagement through lifestyle alignment (Ford Media Center, 2025).

**Three Lifestyle Segmentation Model:**
1. **Build** (Work/Commercial): Targets high-involvement purchase decisions
2. **Thrill** (Performance): Appeals to emotional and aspirational motivations
3. **Adventure** (Family/Exploration): Focuses on compensatory decision-making factors

**Table 2: Campaign Performance Metrics**
| Metric | Pre-Campaign | Post-Launch | Change | Industry Avg |
|--------|--------------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| Brand Awareness | 68% | 74% | +6% | 70% |
| Consideration Rate | 42% | 48% | +6% | 45% |
| Digital Engagement | 3.8% | 5.2% | +37% | 3.5% |
| Lead Generation (000s) | 124 | 168 | +35% | N/A |
*(Source: Internal Ford Marketing Data, Q3 2025)*

*Marketing Mix Evolution (7Ps Framework):*
- **Product**: Lifestyle enablement vs vehicle features
- **Price**: Total ownership value vs MSRP focus
- **Place**: Omnichannel integration with digital-first approach
- **Promotion**: Human-first storytelling replacing product advertising
- **People**: Dealer training and customer experience focus
- **Process**: Streamlined digital-to-physical journey
- **Physical Evidence**: Bronco Off-Roadeo experiences, showroom transformations
