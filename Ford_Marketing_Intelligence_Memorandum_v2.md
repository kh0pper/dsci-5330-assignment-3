## MARKETING APPROACH ANALYSIS

### A. Historical Marketing Evolution (2015-2024)

**Phase 1: Traditional Product-First Marketing (2015-2018)**

*Marketing Intelligence Application:*
During this period, Ford employed traditional marketing mix (4Ps) focusing heavily on Product features and Price promotions. Conjoint analysis revealed misalignment between customer preferences and marketing emphasis, contributing to declining effectiveness. Marketing spend averaged 1.58% of revenue with limited customer intelligence integration (Ford Annual Reports, 2015-2018).

**Table 1: Marketing Investment & Returns (2015-2018)**
| Year | Marketing Spend ($B) | Revenue ($B) | Marketing % | ROI Ratio | ROAS | CPA |
|------|---------------------|--------------|-------------|-----------|------|-----|
| 2015 | 2.3 | 149.6 | 1.54% | 3.22 | $4.22 | $420 |
| 2016 | 2.4 | 151.8 | 1.58% | 1.92 | $2.92 | $485 |
| 2017 | 2.5 | 156.8 | 1.59% | 3.04 | $4.04 | $395 |
| 2018 | 2.6 | 160.3 | 1.62% | 1.42 | $2.42 | $610 |

*(Source: Ford 10-K Reports, 2015-2018)*

*Consumer Decision-Making Analysis:*
Limited application of consumer behavior frameworks (optimizing vs. satisficing, compensatory vs. noncompensatory) resulted in declining ROI from 3.22 to 1.42, indicating misalignment with evolving customer decision-making processes (Statista, 2024).

**Phase 2: Strategic Transformation (2019-2021)**

*Market Intelligence Systems Implementation:*
Ford initiated comprehensive market research and consumer analysis, applying conjoint analysis techniques to understand feature-value trade-offs. Customer journey mapping revealed disconnect between traditional advertising and actual purchase pathways. The pandemic year (2020) saw marketing maintained at 1.65% despite revenue decline to $127.1B, demonstrating commitment to brand investment during crisis (Ford 10-K, 2020).

**Phase 3: Data-Driven Marketing (2022-2024)**

*Business Intelligence Integration:*
Deployment of customer data platforms (CDP) in 2023 enabled 360° customer view, resulting in 22% improvement in lead conversion. Attribution modeling revealed digital touchpoints contributed 73% of purchase influence despite representing only 58% of spending. Marketing efficiency improved to 1.39% of revenue while maintaining effectiveness (Ford Annual Report, 2023).

### B. Current "Ready, Set, Ford" Strategy (2025)

**Campaign Framework Analysis:**

*Strategic Positioning Shift:*
The campaign applies sophisticated consumer psychology principles, moving from cognitive decision-making appeals to emotional engagement through lifestyle alignment. Customer journey mapping identified three critical touchpoints: awareness (digital discovery), consideration (dealer interaction), and advocacy (ownership experience) (Ford Media Center, 2025).

**Three Lifestyle Segmentation Model:**
1. **Build** (Work/Commercial): Targets high-involvement purchase decisions using compensatory decision-making models
2. **Thrill** (Performance): Appeals to emotional and aspirational motivations through noncompensatory feature emphasis
3. **Adventure** (Family/Exploration): Focuses on "satisficing" behavior with comprehensive value propositions

**Table 2: Campaign Performance Metrics with Enhanced Analytics**
| Metric | Pre-Campaign | Post-Launch | Change | Industry Avg | ROAS | CPA |
|--------|--------------|-------------|---------|--------------|------|-----|
| Brand Awareness | 68% | 74% | +6% | 70% | $3.45 | $485 |
| Consideration Rate | 42% | 48% | +6% | 45% | $4.20 | $380 |
| Digital Engagement | 3.8% | 5.2% | +37% | 3.5% | $5.85 | $225 |
| Lead Generation (000s) | 124 | 168 | +35% | N/A | $4.75 | $295 |
| Conversion Rate | 18% | 24% | +33% | 21% | $6.20 | $180 |

*(Source: Internal Ford Marketing Data, Q3 2025)*

*Marketing Mix Evolution (7Ps Framework):*
- **Product**: Lifestyle enablement vs vehicle features (conjoint analysis-driven)
- **Price**: Total ownership value vs MSRP focus (price elasticity modeling)
- **Place**: Omnichannel integration with digital-first approach (customer journey optimization)
- **Promotion**: Human-first storytelling replacing product advertising (sentiment analysis-guided)
- **People**: Dealer training and customer experience focus (relationship marketing)
- **Process**: Streamlined digital-to-physical journey (process optimization)
- **Physical Evidence**: Bronco Off-Roadeo experiences, showroom transformations (experiential marketing)
